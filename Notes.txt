-Keeps adding itself to the prio queue

-Probably gets solved when I get to stop adding itself
-This should be solved when I fix my inifity function



















TA Q's
-If we end up backtracking to another piece in the prio queue, do we reset bssf?
    -Don't set BSSF until  I get a solution
-What is pruning
    -Pop off queue & greater than bssf
    -Child lower bound is greater than BSSF

Priority queue:

 SO:
    -Set BSSF after solution is found
    -Pruning includes <BSSF also.
    -Need to continually go to make to find the best solution


- Need to keep count of how many states there are(easy)
- Need to keep track of queue size at it's largest

Functions to finish:
    -Branch and bound()
    -Insert to queue
    -Check valid path
    -Make infinities
    -

Functions that are working:
    -Reduced cost()
